# Adobe Bridge Custom Metadata JSON GLAM Presets


Set of presets to read and write GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives & Museums) metadata & others, for "Custom Metadata Panel for Bridge" [https://github.com/adobe-dmeservices/custom-metadata]


Currently the DC, ISAD(G), Photoshop, xmpRights & VRA Essential XMP presets are published and soon I hope to create presets for EAD, SPECTRUM & more.

Thanks a lot for your feedback !
